# SVG-KeySplines-Control

This is a control I created to modify the [keySplines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/keySplines) attribute of an [SVG <animate>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/animate) element. It allows me to try out different key spline values and view the resulting animation instantly.
